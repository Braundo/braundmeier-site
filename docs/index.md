Welcome to the GraphQL Guide, a quick and easy-to-digest summary of core GraphQL concepts intended to help get you from zero to proficient!  
<br>

The focus of this guide centers around using GraphQL with Apollo, which is one of the most popular client/servers to use along with GraphQL. While you can certainly learn and leverage GraphQL without Apollo, but in my experience Apollo makes it much easier.
